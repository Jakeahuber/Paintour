# Paintour
Paintour is an iOS application where users draw a new prompt every 24 hours and share their drawings with friends, leveraging React Native, Firebase, Express, Node.js, and Expo. The drawing prompt changes every day at 12:00 AM EST. Users must draw prompts with the built-in drawing canvas, which utilizes Google's Skia Graphics Engine.
