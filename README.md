Paintour is an iOS application where users draw a new prompt every 24 hours and share their drawings with friends, leveraging React Native, Firebase, Express, Node.js, and Expo. The drawing prompt changes every day at 12:00 AM EST. Users must draw prompts with the built-in drawing canvas, which utilizes Google's Skia Graphics Engine.

## Why Make Paintour?
Growing up, I loved to draw and animate, specifically cartoony stuff. And when I initially got into Computer Science, one of my goals was to find a way to integrate software with art. Paintour helped me accomplish this goal. Not only is the app drawing focused, it also includes drawing and animations on the UI that I made. 

## How To Use
Send an email to paintour.app@gmail.com for a TestFlight invite! 

## Future Plans

I hope to release this app to the app store for general public use, likely around the beginning of 2025. I plan to wait until then, as I anticipate I'll have more time to dedicate to maintaining and advertising the app. In the meantime, I plan on migrating my backend off of Firebase to AWS for better scalability. To prepare for that, I am currently working on my AWS Certified Developer - Associate certification.
